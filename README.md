## Codewars

This is the GitHub repository where I save copies of the katas I've completed on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com).

I am trying to spend some time at Codewars to improve my algorithmic and coding skills. When I find some time I push my solutions and collect them at this repository.

### Description about Codewars
It is a website in which users from all over the world are creating language problems (kata) and challange other users. As you solve those challanges and depending on how good your solution, you simply level up. Codewars includes many problems (challanges) for wide range of computer languages from C to Kotlin.

### Kyu system
In codewars, the level means kyu. And as you have more kyu you face with more difficult challenges. Each challenge is called kata.
The below scheme depicts the leveling system.

### Codewars is fun!
I highly recommend to spend some time in codewars. At least give it a try for once, you will not regret because it is a pure fun. Besides, you learn programming by struggling to find answers for the questions and provide you an environment to apply your skills and hence, develop yourself.

### Python
I am only using Python in codewars for now. Since I am a young and inexperienced computational biologist I am not good at coding too. Therefore, if you are going to take a look at my Python solutions, please be careful :)

### Warning
I believe it is not logical to copy and paste someone's solutions from any places. It is bad to be a copycat and codewars will most probably detect that you are cheating. Then, this will follow by a permenant ban from the system..
